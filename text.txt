Every time when I get on the bus, I won't choose to sit down

guilty to sit down. In the last decades, we had been educated 
to let the old and sick people to sit down in the bus. It was 
the tradition to respect the old in China. But from the news, 
we have witnessed some old people are rude. They thought it was 
their privilege to have the seat, so when they weren't offered 
the seat in the bus, they blamed the young people. Actually, it 
is the young people's choice to decide whether they want to offer 
the seat or not. The old people should be gratitude and be nice 
to the one who help them.
